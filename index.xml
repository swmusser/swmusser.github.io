      <title>Physics and Mathematics Instruction</title>
      <link>https://swmusser.github.io/post/physics-instruction/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In many of the physics courses I&amp;rsquo;ve taken in my undergraduate and graduate years &lt;em&gt;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&lt;/em&gt; have been presented as the gold standard when it comes to physics instruction. They certainly left their impact on me; Feynman&amp;rsquo;s discussion of thermodynamics as illustrated by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_ratchet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brownian ratchet&lt;/a&gt; is a fresh way to approach the subject and I find myself returning to it from time to time. As with this example, much of Feyman&amp;rsquo;s technique relied on rebuilding a subject&amp;rsquo;s instruction from the ground up, attempting to present every subject with maximum appeal to intuition. That approach worked well for him in part because he was a genius and in part because he &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman#Pedagogy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;devoted a lot of time to preparing the lectures&lt;/a&gt;. This makes Feynman&amp;rsquo;s method of instruction nigh on impossible to replicate by your average physicist, though some do try with varying success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better model for your average physics instructor is, in my view, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Tong&amp;rsquo;s lecture notes&lt;/a&gt;. I think his real success is not necessarily in rebuilding entire subjects, but rather in presenting them in a way that is easily digestible by a motivated student. Presenting physics in this way is a teachable skill, and relies on a basic algorithmic lesson structure. The basic format is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Motivating Example: begin with a motivating example. Fully explore the example at the level of students&amp;rsquo; current understanding. A good example will be simple, perhaps even one that students have encountered before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) General Theory: introduce the theory you want to teach the students about. Whenever possible, tie it back to the motivating example in order to provide grounding and sanity checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Demonstrate Value: use the general theory you&amp;rsquo;ve built up to analyze other more difficult systems. This demonstrates the utility of what you&amp;rsquo;ve taught to students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see Tong use this approach in his lecture notes on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/sft/sft.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Statistical Field Theory&lt;/a&gt; (SFT). His goal is to teach students about renormalization. He begins with the Ising Model, the simple model many advanced undergraduates are already familiar with. Then for almost the next hundred pages he introduces crucial concepts of SFT, all linked back to the Ising Model. Eventually he builds to renormalization and the renormalization group, but with all path integrals being done for the Ising Model. Since he has spent significant time building students&amp;rsquo; intuitions about the model it is much easier to follow these sometimes lengthy calculations. Finally, in the last section of his notes he turns to the more difficult $ O(N) $ models, applying the tools of renormalization that he carefully built using the Ising Model. He finishes with a fascinating discussion of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, hinting at topological phase transitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example of this approach comes from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/dbs26/AQFT.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Skinner&amp;rsquo;s lecture notes&lt;/a&gt; on Quantum Field Theory (QFT). One of his goals is to give students an intuition for the types of interactions produced by integrating out a degree of freedom from a theory. To do so he considers a particular theory&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
