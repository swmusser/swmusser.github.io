      <description>Back in high school when I took AP Calc BC I encountered integration using partial fractions. Later, while fooling around with the idea I realized I could use it to connect trigonometric functions and imaginary numbers. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it at the time, but shortly thereafter I learned of Euler&amp;rsquo;s formula and realized that I had stumbled upon a way to &amp;ldquo;prove&amp;rdquo; this relation using integration techniques familiar to most students of calculus.</description>

      <description>In many of the physics courses I&amp;rsquo;ve taken in my undergraduate and graduate years The Feynman Lectures on Physics have been presented as the gold standard when it comes to physics instruction. They certainly left their impact on me; Feynman&amp;rsquo;s discussion of thermodynamics as illustrated by the Brownian ratchet is a fresh way to approach the subject and I find myself returning to it from time to time. As with this example, much of Feyman&amp;rsquo;s technique relied on rebuilding a subject&amp;rsquo;s instruction from the ground up, attempting to present every subject with maximum appeal to intuition.</description>
