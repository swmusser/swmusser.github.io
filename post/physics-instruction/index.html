    <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>In many of the physics courses I&rsquo;ve taken in my undergraduate and graduate years <em>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</em> have been presented as the gold standard when it comes to physics instruction. They certainly left their impact on me; Feynman&rsquo;s discussion of thermodynamics as illustrated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_ratchet" target="_blank">Brownian ratchet</a> is a fresh way to approach the subject and I find myself returning to it from time to time. As with this example, much of Feyman&rsquo;s technique relied on rebuilding a subject&rsquo;s instruction from the ground up, attempting to present every subject with maximum appeal to intuition. That approach worked well for him in part because he was a genius and in part because he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman#Pedagogy" target="_blank">devoted a lot of time to preparing the lectures</a>. This makes Feynman&rsquo;s method of instruction nigh on impossible to replicate by your average physicist, though some do try with varying success.</p>

<p>A better model for your average physics instructor is, in my view, <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html" target="_blank">David Tong&rsquo;s lecture notes</a>. I think his real success is not necessarily in rebuilding entire subjects, but rather in presenting them in a way that is easily digestible by a motivated student. Presenting physics in this way is a teachable skill, and relies on a basic algorithmic lesson structure. The basic format is as follows:</p>

<p>1) Motivating Example: begin with a motivating example. Fully explore the example at the level of students&rsquo; current understanding. A good example will be simple, perhaps even one that students have encountered before.</p>

<p>2) General Theory: introduce the theory you want to teach the students about. Whenever possible, tie it back to the motivating example in order to provide grounding and sanity checks.</p>

<p>3) Demonstrate Value: use the general theory you&rsquo;ve built up to analyze other more difficult systems. This demonstrates the utility of what you&rsquo;ve taught to students.</p>

<p>We can see Tong use this approach in his lecture notes on <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/sft/sft.pdf" target="_blank">Statistical Field Theory</a> (SFT). His goal is to teach students about renormalization. He begins with the Ising Model, the simple model many advanced undergraduates are already familiar with. Then for almost the next hundred pages he introduces crucial concepts of SFT, all linked back to the Ising Model. Eventually he builds to renormalization and the renormalization group, but with all path integrals being done for the Ising Model. Since he has spent significant time building students&rsquo; intuitions about the model it is much easier to follow these sometimes lengthy calculations. Finally, in the last section of his notes he turns to the more difficult $ O(N) $ models, applying the tools of renormalization that he carefully built using the Ising Model. He finishes with a fascinating discussion of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, hinting at topological phase transitions.</p>

<p>Another example of this approach comes from <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/dbs26/AQFT.html" target="_blank">David Skinner&rsquo;s lecture notes</a> on Quantum Field Theory (QFT). In order to introduce the formalism of the path integral Skinner begins with QFT in zero dimensions, his motivating example. In zero dimensions a real valued field is just a single real number, and the space of all field configurations is just $ \mathbb{R} $. This means that the path integrals are just ordinary integrals, something all students have seen before. Skinner then uses this motivating example to demonstrate how integrating out higher energy fields can generate all interactions allowed by symmetry. This is a hugely important concept in QFT, and it was one that seemed really mysterious to me when I first encountered it. I had the misconception that the generation of all these extra terms was something that was coming from the (to me) inaccessible path integral. When I took Skinner&rsquo;s class and saw that it was something that would actually arise from a familiar old integral, it not only helped me to understand the general theory of path integrals, but also made it much more accessible to me by tying it back to a simple example I understood well. Skinner then very skillfully used his toy model to illustrate a whole host of other important concepts in QFT.</p>

<p>Of course even though the examples I&rsquo;ve just described were related to field theory, the algorithmic lesson structure outlined above can be hugely useful for any subject in physics and mathematics. If you are teaching middle schoolers about chemistry the motivating example might be more physical, e.g. simply dropping a piece of Sodium into water and watching the reaction unfold. This piques the interest of the students, and makes an explanation of chemical reactions that much easier to understand and to follow. If you are presenting analysis to students for the first time, motivating $ \epsilon-\delta $ proofs with graphs of simple functions like $ f(x)=x $ helps students latch on to why one defines a limit in this way. You can then develop the general theory of limits and finally extend it to complicated examples that are difficult to picture graphically, e.g. perhaps the Weierstrass function.</p>

<p>Maybe now that I&rsquo;ve gone through all these examples you find this lecture structure to be obvious. But in my experience it is rarely put to use, or at least used well, in the classroom. I&rsquo;ve seen professors deviate from it many times, for what I would guess are a multitude of reasons: some want to surprise the students with a beautiful proof and fear if they motivate it too much they&rsquo;ll give away the game, some simply cannot look at their subject with the eyes of a newcomer and they focus on small details that to them seem important (but fail to give a clear overarching motivating example), some try to replicate Feynman&rsquo;s pedagogy and fall short, but most are just too busy to think about presenting their topic in this way. Indeed when I was a tutor for the introductory calculus sequence at UChicago I myself fell into all of these traps at various times. However, in spite of the difficulty in structuring one&rsquo;s lessons in this way I think it is worth the effort in order to help students&rsquo; understanding, and I will continue to look to <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html" target="_blank">David Tong&rsquo;s lecture notes</a> for inspiration while I put in this effort.</p>
