      <description>Physical Review Letters recently published research I did as an undergraduate in the Irvine lab, Starting Flow Past an Airfoil and its Acquired Lift in a Superfluid. I wanted to write a blog post about it, and since flying in a superfluid strikes me as something that might be interesting to the broader physics community, I checked physics.stackexchange.com. To my pleasant surprise I was able to find not one, but two questions related to flight in a superfluid.</description>
